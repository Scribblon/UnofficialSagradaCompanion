# Unofficial Sagrada Companion App
Sagrada is a boardgame made by Floodgate.

This app aims to make scoring easier by providing several tools.
For now my aim is to provide a simple table to input points, and calculate the end result.

Planned is to integrate image recognition to determine the dice layout and calculate the scores auto-magically.

A programming project started to dust off my programming skills and learn C# and the Xamarin framework.
